## Structure - tidy code
- extensions: Holds objects that entail Kotlin extension functions. This makes it possible to access and use such functions from any class in the app without creating another instance of their parent.

- utils: Contains utilities used in the app. In our case, this only contains Firebase utilities.

- views: This contains the UI-related classes.


## project structure
- Joe: to be standardized,
we can all use JDK 11 first and upgrade it to a newer version later
we need to standardize gradle version too

- **Note:** Don't update dependencies because it may cause incompatibility issues
